## Heart-Disease-Prediction 

### Overview

A simple web application which uses Machine Learning algorithm to predict the heart condition of a person by providing some inputs about the person health like age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level etc built using `Flask` 

  
**A Demo of the Web App :**

 ### Technical Aspect
 
 This Project is mainly divided into two parts:
 
 1. Exploring the dataset and traning the model using `Sklearn`.
 2. Building and hosting a `flask` web app on `Heroku`.


**About the repository Structure :**

- Project consist `app.py` script which is used to run the application and is engine of this app. contians API that gets input from the user and computes a predicted value based on the model.
- `prediction.py` contains code to build and train a Machine learning model.
- *templates* folder contains two files `main.html` and `result.html` which describe the structure of the app and the way this web application behaves. These files are connected with Python via Flask framework.  
- *static* folder contains file `style.css` which adds some styling and enhance the look of the application. 



### Future work 

- improve model performance.
- Add more better styling to the user interface.
